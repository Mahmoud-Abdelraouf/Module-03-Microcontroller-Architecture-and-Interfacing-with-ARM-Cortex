## Project Proposal: PWM Drawer with Real-Time Display on Graphical LCD

### Project Overview:

The PWM Drawer project aims to develop a real-time PWM signal measurement and visualization tool. The system will capture PWM signals using hardware input capture, calculate the PWM frequency and duty cycle, and display the waveform in real-time on a graphical LCD. This project will provide valuable insights into PWM signals' characteristics and allow users to observe and analyze PWM waveforms quickly and accurately.

### Features:

1. Hardware Input Capture: Utilize the hardware input capture capability of the ATmega32 (AVR) microcontroller to accurately measure the PWM signal pulse width and calculate the frequency.
2. Graphical LCD Interface: Interface with a graphical LCD (e.g., ST7735, SSD1306) using a suitable graphical LCD library (e.g., u8g2) to draw real-time PWM waveforms.
3. Real-Time Display: Continuously update the graphical LCD with the latest PWM measurements, providing real-time visualization of the PWM waveform.
4. Frequency and Duty Cycle Calculation: Implement algorithms to calculate the PWM frequency and duty cycle based on the captured pulse width.
5. User Interface: Develop a user interface to control the PWM measurements and display settings. Use buttons or a touchscreen to start/stop measurements, switch between PWM channels, and adjust display parameters.
6. Data Logging (Optional): Add an optional feature to log captured PWM data to external storage (e.g., SD card) for further analysis or export to a computer.

### Hardware Requirements:

1. ATmega32 (AVR) Development Board.
2. Graphical LCD Module (e.g., ST7735, SSD1306) with appropriate interface (SPI/I2C).
3. Potentiometer (optional) to simulate variable PWM input.
4. User Input Components (e.g., buttons, touchscreen) for the user interface.
5. External Storage (e.g., SD card) if data logging is implemented.

### Software Components:

1. STM32 HAL Library: Use the STM32 HAL library to configure the microcontroller's GPIO, TIM, and other peripherals.
2. Graphical LCD Library: Utilize a graphical LCD library (e.g., u8g2) to draw PWM waveforms and text on the graphical LCD.
3. Input Capture and PWM Measurement: Implement interrupt-driven code to capture PWM signals using hardware input capture and calculate frequency and duty cycle.
4. User Interface: Create a user interface to control PWM measurements and display settings.
5. Data Logging (Optional): If data logging is required, implement code to write captured data to external storage.

### Milestones:

1. Hardware and Software Setup: Configure the ATmega32 (AVR) development board and establish communication with the graphical LCD module.
2. PWM Measurement: Implement hardware input capture to measure PWM signals and calculate frequency and duty cycle.
3. Real-Time Display: Create a real-time display loop to continuously update the graphical LCD with PWM waveforms.
4. User Interface: Develop a user interface to control PWM measurements and display settings.
5. Data Logging (Optional): Implement data logging functionality if required.
6. Testing and Debugging: Test the system thoroughly, identify and fix any bugs, and optimize performance.
7. Documentation and Presentation: Document the project thoroughly, including hardware connections, code explanations, and user instructions. Prepare a presentation to demonstrate the project's functionality.

### Conclusion:

The PWM Drawer with Real-Time Display project aims to provide a valuable tool for measuring and visualizing PWM waveforms. By using hardware input capture and graphical LCD interface, the system will offer accurate and real-time representation of PWM signals. The user-friendly interface and optional data logging make it suitable for various applications, including debugging PWM-controlled systems, testing motor control, and analyzing power circuits.
